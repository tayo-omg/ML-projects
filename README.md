Machine learning projects

This is a self made project just to understand ML better and have a better insight on Regression, Classification and Clustering. So I decided to work with a data that I have worked and been graded on to pridect how the system would continue with Machine Learning.


This took a lot, I had to watch videos and do courses to understand the foundation of Machine Learning.
